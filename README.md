Categories:
Todo's are listed under 'categories'. The default category being the 'Home' one that is always present in the left side bar.

To add a new category click the '+' button on the left sidebar, a textbox will open where your can type in the name of the category you would like to add (note - category titles must be unique). Clicking the '>' button next to the input will add the category to the sidebar.
